# AirHockeyOSC

An air hockey 2D game made in Unity, where each player controls a striker with their mobile devices.
Based on Thomas Fredericks - UnityOSC.

Code-object association:

2 Emptys (OSC Receivers)            - OSC.cs, with a port for each player
2 Images (Players)                  - oscTeste.cs
2 Box Colliders (Goals)             - baliza.cs
1 Image (Puck)                      - bola.cs

There are the minimum requirements for the project to work. 

Troubleshooting: If using W10 and neither of the players is moving try turning off the 'Public Network' firewall.
